Added:
  ∙ Added the ability to hide FreeText annotations using the 'Hide Annotations' button.
  ∙ Added support for CID-keyed fonts with external CMap tables. (DOC-1328)
    New options:
      cMapUrl - in some cases, predefined character map files are needed to show Chinese, Japanese, or Korean text output.
        The cMapUrl option specifies the URL of the folder where the CMap files are located. The default value is 'resources/bcmaps/'.
        A CMap specifies the mapping from character codes to character selectors, it is used to extract Unicode text from a PDF document.
        In most cases the CMaps are fully embedded in the PDF document, but sometimes a CMap in a PDF is specified by a PDF name object,
        where this name identifies a predefined CMap that should be known to the PDF processor. The compressed predefined CMaps
        that are included with GcPdfViewer are located in the 'resources/bcmaps/' folder, and have the .bin extension.
      cMapPacked - if true, the viewer will look for the compressed version of the CMap files (with the extension '.bin'),
        otherwise the viewer will look for unpacked CMap files without extension. The default value is true.
